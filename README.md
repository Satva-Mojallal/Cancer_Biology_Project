A study log and project documentation for my cancer biology and systems biology learning jorney.
# Systems Biology Course Project – Cancer Focus

This repository documents my progress in a project-oriented Systems Biology course focused on cancer and computational methods. The course integrates biological foundations with bioinformatics, programming (Python, R, JavaScript), and systems-level approaches to studying cancer development and progression.

## 📍 Current Progress

### ✅ Week 1 – Foundational Concepts

- Topics Covered:
  - Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
  - Gene expression and the flow of genetic information (DNA → RNA → Protein)
  - Transcription and translation machinery
  - Mutation types and their role in cancer development

- Mutation Types Discussed:
  - Point mutations (e.g., insertion, deletion, inversion)
  - Missense and silent mutations
  - How mutations affect gene expression and protein function in oncogenesis

---

## 📌 Course Objectives

As the course progresses, I will work on a cancer-related computational project that includes:

- Extracting and analyzing data from biological databases
- Applying bioinformatics tools to model gene interactions
- Using programming (Python, R, JavaScript) to interpret biological data
- Building a final presentation or paper based on findings

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Start hands-on activities with databases and cancer datasets
- Begin scripting analyses in Python or R
- Update this repository weekly with new sections and insights

---

## 🧠 Goal

To develop strong skills in systems biology and computational cancer research and showcase my active learning process as I pursue PhD opportunities in computational and cancer biology


#Add Session 2

# Session 2 – Exploring Gene-Disease Associations in Cancer

In this session, we concluded our discussions on gene mutations and began working with real databases to explore genetic mutations in cancer. We focused on tools and platforms that help investigate the relationships between genes and diseases, particularly within the context of oncology.

---

## 🧠 Topics Reviewed (Theory)

- Central dogma of biology: DNA → RNA → Protein
- Types of mutations:
  - Point mutations: substitution, insertion, deletion, inversion
  - Missense, nonsense, and silent mutations
- How these mutations can disrupt gene function and contribute to cancer

## 🧪 Databases & Tools Explored

### 1. HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee)
- Website providing official gene names and symbols
- Helps resolve ambiguity caused by multiple names for a single gene
- Useful for consistent gene identification across databases

### 2. dbGaP + PheGenI (Phenotype–Genotype Integrator)
- Provided by NCBI
- Allows you to input a disease and find related genes, or vice versa
- Useful in identifying genotype–phenotype correlations in cancer

### 3. OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man)
- Database for mapping genes to human disorders
- Offers detailed descriptions of genetic conditions
- Especially useful for understanding hereditary cancer syndromes

### 4. DisGeNET
- Database focused on gene–disease associations
- Offers scores such as:
  - DSI (Disease Specificity Index): How specific a gene is to a given disease
  - DPI (Disease Pleiotropy Index): How many different diseases a gene is involved in
  - GDA Score: Strength of association between a gene and a disease
- Very useful for analyzing gene involvement across various cancers

## 💡 Summary

This session provided a hands-on introduction to several major biomedical databases used in systems biology and cancer genomics. I learned how to navigate and cross-reference gene information and identify gene–disease links using publicly available tools.
